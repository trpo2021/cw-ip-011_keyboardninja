Arthur Granville, vicar of St. Thomas, had been guiding his small congregation for twenty-five years. He was a modest man, without pretensions, and was content with little in life.
If the birth of a third daughter disappointed Arthur Grandville, he did not show it. But perhaps his attachment to Sally was due to a fear that the girl might feel unwelcome in the family.
The fairies who greeted the girls at the font did not skimp on gifts. They gave Anne beauty, Marigold charm, and Sally intelligence. When there was a big decision to be made, everyone in the family always consulted Sally; it was Sally who came to the rescue when life seemed to be going downhill; it was Sally who could be relied on when things got tough. No one remembered that she was not yet eighteen.
Marigold turned away from him in exasperation. The young man's adoration bored her. Actually, she liked him because he was sometimes useful as a friend or a sworn brother, but Marigold didn't find David attractive, and she was angry when he tried to change their relationship.
David turned and looked at her. She was looking straight at him, and she was very pretty in that moment, with her big eyes full of compassion, and a sympathetic smile on her lips.
He gripped the girl's hands tightly and released them immediately as Sally and Anne entered with a tray. The tea party was spent in pleasant, friendly conversation, and when the meal was over, David began to take his leave.
He got into the car and waved at her. Suddenly she seemed so small and touching on the steps of the old vicarage. The house was poorly planned, and its architecture was not at all pleasing to the eye, but for David it was one of the most wonderful places in the world thanks to those who lived in this house.
The sea was calmer than it had been a few hours ago, but the waves were still rolling over the rocks, scattering silvery spray all around. Sally listened to the sound of the surf, and suddenly tears welled up in her eyes and rolled down her cheeks. This is her world, and she has to leave it. In desperation, she stretched out her hands to the water.
He didn't have much time to walk; he even knew how many paces from the gate of his house: exactly seven hundred and thirty. He counted them once, when he was really dreaming. At that time, he himself still did not believe these dreams of his own, and only irritated himself with their ugly, but tempting audacity.
He flinched, his nerves too weak this time. A little later, the door opened a tiny crack: the tenant was looking at the newcomer from the crack with visible disbelief, and only her eyes were visible, glittering out of the darkness.
A lamp burned in the corner in front of a small image. Everything was very clean: both the furniture and the floors were polished to a high gloss; everything shone. "Lizaveta's work," thought the young man.
The old woman reached into her pocket for her keys and went into the other room behind the curtains. The young man, left alone in the middle of the room, listened curiously and thought. I could hear her unlocking the dresser.
But no one shared his happiness; his silent companion looked at all these outbursts with even hostility and distrust. There was another man who looked like a retired official.
There are other meetings, even with completely unfamiliar people, in which we begin to be interested at first sight, somehow suddenly, suddenly, before we say a word. This was exactly the impression made on Raskolnikov by the guest who sat at a distance and looked like a retired official.
The door to the further rooms or cells into which Amalia Lippevechsel's apartment was divided was ajar. It was noisy and loud. They laughed. I think they were playing cards and drinking tea. Sometimes the most ungracious words came out.
For a whole month we had gossip all over the city about this story, and it came to such a point that we could not even go to church with Dunya because of the contemptuous looks and whispers, and even aloud in front of us there were conversations.
Klimov considered himself an offended and unappreciated being, an educated and metropolitan man, who would not live in Moscow, without work, in some backwater, and if he drank, as he himself expressed himself with deliberation and pounding on his chest,then it was out of grief that he drank.
Tatiana, who, as we have said above, was a laundress (although, as a skilled and learned laundress, she was entrusted with only fine linen), was a woman of about twenty years old, small, thin, fair, with moles on her left cheek.
She was about to refuse, but he forcibly shoved it into her hand, shook his head, walked away, and, turning around, once again mumbled something very friendly to her.
Gerasim suddenly raised himself, stretched out his huge hand, laid it on the head of the castellan, and looked into her face with such sullen ferocity that she crouched down to the table. Everyone fell silent. Gerasim picked up his spoon again and continued to slurp the soup.
